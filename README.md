# 2024 TMBST Hackathon
A Discord Activity for the TMBST Hackathon

## Idea 
My general idea for this hackathon activity is to create a game set in the oceans of a far distant planet where you command and maintain a research vessel and protect it against sea creatures, obstacles, and more. You are tasked to get the submarine to a designated location and complete certain tasks a long the way.
